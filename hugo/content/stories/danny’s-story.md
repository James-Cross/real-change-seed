  body: "## \LStuart's Story *\n\nStuart is an ex-serviceman who had been living in a tent for over a year. Local organisation EDs Homes had been in touch with him and building up their trust and relationship.\n\nJust before Real Change was launched, Stuart received a job offer for full time work. This was great news, but very hard to take up without secure, stable accomodation where he could properly sleep, live and go out to work without worrying about his things being safe.\n\nEDs enquired whether this would be suitable for Real Change, and started looking for appropriate places Stuart could live. When one was found an application was put in and Real Change was able to help cover the deposit and first months’ rent. Having been out of work and with no landlord who could provide a reference, the grant was about more than just money. It also unlocked a door into the private sector when landlords might otherwise have been nervous about taking on a new tenant.\n\n**There were tears in Stuart’s eyes when he moved into the flat, and he was immediately offering to pay it back!**"

    Our first concern is making sure he’s got enough to cover his own costs, but
    his generosity after everything he’s been through is an example to everyone.
    If he has the cash spare in the future it will go straight back into the pot
    to help others who are homeless!


    Since moving in, Stuart has decorated the flat to make it feel like home and
    is working hard at his new job. He is also spending lots of time with his
    family, something that is very hard to do if you are living in a tent, an
    aspect of homelessness we often forget.


    It’s been a privilege to help Stuart, and we look forward to hearing more
    about his journey in the future!
