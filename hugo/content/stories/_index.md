  hero: Real Change in Guildford **Stories**
intro: >-
  **Michael had lived and worked in Guildford all his life. 2 years ago Michael
  was made redundant from his job where he had been working for the past 18
  months. Previous to this Michael, worked in the same job for 15 years but left
  to further develop his career in engineering.  Michael, struggled to find
  alternative employment and slowly he felt his life spiral out of control. the
  only option available to Michael, was to access welfare benefits, however even
  this door closed on him as the ID he had, expired 6 months ago, and without
  correct ID, he was unable to claim benefits including housing costs. Michael
  had no money to renew his ID, he was using food banks regularly so he could
  feed himself whilst his debts continued to rise as he was unable to pay for
  utilities and other associated living costs. Sadly, Michael eventually lost
  his home and ended up rough sleeping in Farnham, as he was too ashamed to
  rough sleep in Guildford. Michael’s self-esteem reduced day by day, he had no
  respect for himself and had lost hope that his situation would ever change.
  Things became too much for Michael and after a failed attempt to take his
  life, he was finally picked up by the mental health team and diagnosed with
  severe depression and anxiety. Michael was assigned a mental health worker who
  applied for funding from local charity’s  so that Michael’s ID can be renewed.
  Once completed, Michael was  referred to a local homeless hostel in Guildford
  which was the glimmer of hope he had been looking for so long!**
