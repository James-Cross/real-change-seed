  body: "## \LAllison's Story\n\nAlison had been living in supported accommodation with Riverside since April 2018 after a relationship breakdown which left her homeless. While staying at the hostel, she put in a lot of work to successfully manage her anxiety and is in complete recovery. Alison also successfully participated and completed the Princes Trust programme which helped her to develop the skills to find employment.\n\nAlison was offered a job in early October, continuing her fantastic journey. With much of her savings going on past debts, however, she was only able to save up some of the money for a deposit in her own rented property.\n\n> \"The support I received made a Real Change to my life. It helped me \n> to secure the lovely flat that I am moving to.\n>\n> Without it I would be living in accommodation that I am unable to afford and this may have led to a decline in my mental well-being and put me at risk of becoming homeless again.\n> \""

    Real Change matched what Alison had saved to achieve her goal of moving to a
    tenancy that is affordable, safe and somewhere she can call home.
    Importantly for someone at her point of life, she has been able to choose a
    reliable landlord who is reputable so this makes her feel secure. Her moving
    on from the hostel has also created a much-need space for someone else
    experiencing homelessness whose not ready to live independently yet.


    Alison is now in full time employment which fills her with confidence, and
    her relationships that had broken down are being rebuilt. She is looking
    forward to a happy and positive future and would like to send thanks
    everyone from the Real Change for helping to achieve her goals. It’s an
    absolute pleasure to be able to do a small bit for someone who has worked so
    hard to turn around their own situation!
