  body: "## \LAllison's Story\n\nAlison had been living in supported accommodation with Riverside since April 2018 after a relationship breakdown which left her homeless. While staying at the hostel, she put in a lot of work to successfully manage her anxiety and is in complete recovery. Alison also successfully participated and completed the Princes Trust programme which helped her to develop the skills to find employment.\n\nAlison was offered a job in early October, continuing her fantastic journey. Still living in the hostel, however, and not eligible for the discounted service rates, her rent shot up massively. With all her savings going on past debts, she was only able to save up some of the money for a deposit in her own rented property.\n\n> \"The support I received made a Real Change to my life. It helped me \n> to secure the lovely flat that I am moving too.\n>\n> Without it I would be living in accommodation that I am unable to afford and this may have led to a decline in my mental wellbeing and put me at risk of becoming homeless again.\n> \""

    Real Change matched what Alison had saved to achieve her goal of moving to a
    tenancy that is affordable, safe and somewhere she can call home. She is now
    excited to move into her tenancy, and has been able to choose a reliable
    landlord who is reputable so this makes her feel secure.


    She is also in full time employment which fills her with confidence and her
    relationships that had broken down are now being rebuilt. Alison is looking
    forward to a happy and positive future and would like to send thanks
    everyone from the Real Change for helping to achieve her goals. It’s an
    absolute pleasure to be able to do a small bit for someone who has worked so
    hard to turn around their own situation!
