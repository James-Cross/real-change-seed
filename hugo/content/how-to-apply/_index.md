content: >-
  Real Change Oldham exists to ensure access to cash is not barrier to people
  getting what they need, when they need it, if they are homeless or at risk.
  However, Oldham is lucky to have a number of schemes that can also help with
  specific items or situations.


  * Job Centre Plus **Flexible Support Scheme:** anyone in receipt of benefits
  can apply to this scheme through their work coach for any job related costs,
  including clothing and travel.

  * Oldham Council Local Welfare Provision (furniture and large items needed to
  establish a home)
