  hero: Real Change Oldham **How to Apply**
content: >-
  Real Change Oldham exists to ensure access to cash is not barrier to people
  getting what they need, when they need it, if they are homeless or at risk.
  However, Oldham is lucky to have a number of schemes that can also help with
  specific items or situations.


  * Job Centre Plus **Flexible Support Scheme:** anyone in receipt of benefits
  can apply to this scheme through their work coach for any job related costs,
  including clothing and travel.

  * Oldham Council [**Local Welfare
  Provision**](https://www.oldham.gov.uk/info/100001/benefits_and_money/1837/emergency_support_-_local_welfare_provision):
  support workers can apply to Oldham Council to cover the items needed to
  establish a home in Oldham, including furniture and white goods. 

  * Spend to Save: the [Housing Options
  Team](https://www.oldham.gov.uk/info/200257/homelessness/2036/at_risk_of_becoming_homeless/12)
  can also apply for funding to help prevent homelessness for anyone at risk
  with 56 days.

  * Threshold [Inside Out Starter Packs](http://thp.org.uk/services/inside-out):
  support workers for people leaving homelessness or temporary accomodation can
  apply for up to Â£50 worth of household items to help start their home,
  including pots, pans and small electrical items, 

  * Local Churches who are registered can apply for items to [Acts
  435](https://acts435.org.uk/)****
