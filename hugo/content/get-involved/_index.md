  ## **Take part in a "fundraising challenge"**


  Sign up to a sponsored run, walk or anything you like and raise money for
  people in your area who are homeless. You can set up a fundraiser page by
  going to www.justgiving.com/campaign/realchangerochdale and clicking
  'Start Fundraising'.

  Toolkit](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/tips/fundraising-page-toolkit)

  ## **Invite us to speak at an event**


  Our Action Group includes people with lived experience of homelessness as well
  as charities working directly with people who are homeless. 


  We'd be delighted to come and talk to you about the Campaign at an event you
  are involved in organising, whether that's the weekly meeting at your church,
  a concert/cultural event, a conference your business in putting on or your
  sports team's AGM. 


  <br>


  ## **Play a role in organising Campaign activities**


  There are lots of roles that need doing to make the campaign a success,
  including:


  \- Assisting with public awareness and creation of content to share with local
  people


  \- Supporting our efforts to get the message out via social media


  \- Helping administer grants to people who are homeless


  \- Being an 'ambassador' for the campaign within a specific area of Wigan
  Borough, or with particular networks such as colleges, churches or community
  groups.


  <br>


  ## **Share your skills or knowledge**


  What are you good at? What do you know lots about? How do you think a campaign
  like ours could benefit from that? There are no bad ideas and we'd love to
  hear yours!
