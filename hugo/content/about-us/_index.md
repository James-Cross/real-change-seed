  title: About Us
intro:
  body: >-
    Providing an alternative to giving on the street, the primary aim of Real
    Help Doncaster is to provide a way for people who want to donate to know
    that their support will contribute to 'real help' instead of money being
    used for the wrong reasons, including possible drug and alcohol abuses and
    contribute to keeping people begging.


    The multi-agency scheme provides quick help for practical items that can
    help people off the street. Local charities and organisations will work
    directly with individuals to apply for funds. It is part of the action plan
    that was agreed by partners to tackle the issues in the town centre and
    anti-social behaviour.


    The Real Help Doncaster partnership includes the Doncaster Business Forum,
    South Yorkshire Police, Doncaster Council, St Leger Homes, Aspire, Doncaster
    Mind, Riverside, Hall Gate United Reformed Church.


    The Real Help Doncaster fund is administered by Changing Lives. Changing
    Lives is a national, registered charity which provides specialist support
    for thousands of vulnerable people and their families.  They are already
    working in Doncaster supporting people with complex needs to make meaningful
    and lasting improvements to their lives.  Changing Lives will work with the
    local action group of Real Help partners to oversee the scheme.  To become a
    partner, see how to get involved.

    street and into a healthier and safer lifestyle. The scheme is encouraging
    people to change the way they give and not give on the street.**
