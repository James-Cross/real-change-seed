    **Real Change is a fund for Oldham that pays for items that local people
    need to end and prevent homelessness.**

    Not a penny goes to salaries for running the campaign. This is because Real
    Change partners have committed the time and energy of their staff to help
    run the campaign for free.


    In fact, if we can claim gift aid from your donation, over £1 can go to
    tackling homeless for every pound you give! This more than covers the small
    card transaction fee taken by the donation website, too, making the most of
    your generosity.

how:

    Your donation is combined with other donations into one central pot for
    everyone in Oldham Borough. [Local charities](/how-to-apply/) and
    organisations then work directly with individuals who are homeless, and
    apply for funds to pay for items they need.


    There are three types of application:

  card1:
    body: >-
      Partner organisations will be forwarded £100 'float' so they can access
      cash immediately for smaller items that people need there and then. This
      prevents anyone having to wait when they are in dire need, and
      experiencing the negative impact on health, welfare and trust that comes
      with not getting support when you need it most.


      This excludes cash, emergency accommodation, food or other items which are
      available for free elsewhere.
    heading: £20-100
    subheading: >-
      (e.g. Education or training courses, essential household items, clothes
      for interviews)
  card2:
    body: >-
      If the request is for over £100, the application must be agreed by an
      independent panel.


      The Panel includes people with lived experience of homelessness alongside
      representatives of support groups and accomodation providers.
    heading: Over £100
    subheading: >-
      (e.g. Deposit or rent, furnishings for a flat, or larger white goods such
      as a fridge or washing machine)
