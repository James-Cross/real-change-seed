  body: |
    Your donation joins the central Real Change funding pot. **[Local charities](#todo)** and organisations work directly with individuals who are homeless, and apply for funds to pay for items they need. Depending on the amount needed, there are two levels of fund requests:
  card1:
    heading: "Under £100"
    subheading: "(e.g. Education or training courses, furniture or househould items, clothes for interviews)"
    body: |
      If the request is for under £100, Real Change partner agencies can submit an online application.

      This excludes cash, emergency accommodation, food or other items which are available for free elsewhere.
  card2:
    heading: "Over £100"
    subheading: "(e.g. Deposit or rent, furnishings for a flat, white goods over £100)"
    body: |
      If the request is for over £100, the application must be agreed by the Real Change panel.

      The Real Change panel includes: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, lorem ipsum dolor sti amet.
