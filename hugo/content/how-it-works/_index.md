    For every £1 you give, 85p goes directly to helping someone in need, and not
    a penny on salaries for running the campaign.  This is because Real Change
    partners have committed the time and energy of their staff to help run the
    campaign for free.

how:
  body: >-
    Your donation is combined with other donations in one central pot. [Local
    charities](/how-to-apply/) and organisations then work directly with
    individuals who are homeless, and apply for funds to pay for items they
    need. Money is transferred to the partner organisations to get where it is
    needed as quickly as possible. 


    There are two types of application:

      If the request is for under £100, applications which meet the criteria are
      approved almost immediately.


      This excludes cash, emergency accommodation, food or other items which are
      available for free elsewhere.
